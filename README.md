##HW1
  *Image Matching (Detecting Motion Vectors)*

1. Use trucka.im as the basis, sample it by an 8x8, 11x11, 15x15, 21x21, 31x31 block.
2. Threshold of search range: 50 pixels. (This is a reference value only!)
3. Dimension of truck is 386x386 with 216 bytes of leading header.
4. Detect motions vectors between trucka.im and truckb.im.
5. You must not use any available libraries beyond image I/O (reading or writing image files from/to the disk/memory). You must do all the requirements by writing your own code (called hardcore programming).

##HW 2
  *Camera Calibration*

1. Calculate the equivalent distance of the real world (#pixels/mm).
2. Calculate field of view in degrees of angle. 
3. You may have to find the parameters of the digital camera you are using.
4. Please specify the parameters you are using, i.e., focal lenght, object length, etc.
5. Please tabulate your result in your report, there may be error between the true "+theoretical" value and the value you measured, but don't worry.

##HW 3
  *Optical Flow*
