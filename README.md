HW1
  Image Matching (Detecting Motion Vectors)

Detect motions vectors between trucka.im and truckb.im.

1.Use trucka.im as the basis, sample it by an 8x8, 11x11, 15x15, 21x21, 31x31 block.
2.Threshold of search range: 50 pixels. (This is a reference value only!)
3.Dimension of truck is 386x386 with 216 bytes of leading header.
4.You must not use any available libraries beyond image I/O (reading or writing image files from/to the disk/memory). You must do all the requirements by writing your own code (called hardcore programming).
